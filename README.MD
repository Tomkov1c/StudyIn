* Principal panel to manage and edit information about the school / courses
* A role system
* Principals can give permissions to teachers in the school to accept applications from users (Students)



# Behind the scenes
The app is coded in PHP



## Frontend
Frontend was made in figma and updated later. Since php doesn't have tempting capabilities like React or other JavaScript frameworks, I decide to make my own system. Each component in the `components` folder is basically a function that i need to `echo` in order for it to display the element in the function. Each element has some parameters I can change in the function calling.


## Backed
Nothing interesting to say about the backend.
